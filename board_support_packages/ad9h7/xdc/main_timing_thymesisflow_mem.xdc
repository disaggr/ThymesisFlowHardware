# FPGA-external clock definitions to help timing analysis
# probably not needed because we configure the reference clock frequency in the aurora core
# but adding anyway for completeness.

##QSFP reference clocks 309.25Mhz


#set false path between aurora reset module (clock domain clock_100) and actual reset pins on aurora module.



# false path constraints for example design paths on aurora
